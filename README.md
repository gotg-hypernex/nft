## Non-fungible · Verification of Original · Traceable

NFT is a digital file with a unique ID that can be verified on a blockchain, and it is not
interchangeable unlike Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are fungible (FT), so it is
different from NFT. This non-fungibility allows NFT to perform the function of proving the
'original’ and entitles as a digital asset that can hold in the rights of almost any tangible
or intangible assets, including artworks, music, videos, collectibles, trading cards, virtual
items, or real estate.

NFTs are also traceable and cannot be duplicated because each NFT contains a unique
serial number or non-replicable 'fingerprint' (hash).

## NFT Brought Revolutionary Changes in the Copyright System

NFT, which destructively innovates the existing copyright system, implements the
creation and transfer of rights such as ownership or copyright to digitally created works
with blockchain technology.
Even if creators do not register their works to the Copyright Association, they can create
their own works as NFTs and announce their creations to the corresponding digital
network, and automatically receive royalties without tracking the use of their works. Since
a revolutionary change has begun in the existing copyright system, people craze about
NFT, a digital asset.

## Visible Digital Asset, NFT

Instead of digital assets that were invisible making doubt for the existence, NFT known as
a visible digital asset is recently all the rage.
GotG issued the world's first tangible asset based NFT in April 2021. The NFTs created by
GotG are visible. We approached NFT in the eyes of Liberal arts, not in the eyes of
technology. Therefore, we could plan and release the differentiated NFT business model
and could still run new businesses with a number of partners.
GotG provides a written NFT digital guarantee (certification of genuine product) for the
products in Amazon Korea Mall by utilizing NFT certification feature. Also, we are
planning to provide consumers 'compensation·guarantee plan' by applying the DAG
solution in case of forgery accidents or copyright violations. Since the native Token(Key
digital token) GotG is used in all processes such as guarantee, insurance, and
compensation, the value of GotG will continue to increase.
